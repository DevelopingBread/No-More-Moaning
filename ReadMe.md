If you hate the new death sound that roblox made. Then welcome, I have made a program that helps you remove the death sound for you!

**But, if you do like it ... then good for you**

Very simple to use, just open it up and leave it running! You can put it into startup, so it can run forever.

## How does this program work?

All it does is that it replaces the sound file every time it gets changed/removed
